    <h1>Your Discipline Companion for Trading</h1>
    <p>93% of retail traders lose money — not due to lack of knowledge, but lack of discipline.</p>
    <p><strong>Manage Mind Money (MMM)</strong> is built to fix that — with strict execution rules, one trade per day, and risk control systems.</p>
    <p>This is not a signal service. It’s a system that protects you from yourself.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Join the discipline-first revolution. Survive. Grow. Win.</p>
